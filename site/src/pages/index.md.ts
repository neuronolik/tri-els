    "- **Bring your own design.** Slab doesn't ship a single line of visual CSS. No theme to fight, nothing to override. Every piece you'd want to style is a `::part()`, and every state you'd react to is a `:state()`.",
    "- **The platform first.** A Slab dialog is a `<dialog>`. A disclosure is a `<details>`. A switch is a checkbox. Slab leans on what browsers already do well and only fills in what's missing. Attributes in, events out.",
    "- **Built to last.** Custom elements are a web standard, not a framework feature, so they work in React, Vue, Svelte, Rails, or plain HTML — and in whatever you're using three years from now.",
